## Introduction

Avalara AvaTax is a cloud-based solution automating transaction tax calculations and the tax filing process. Avalara provides real-time tax calculation using tax content from more than 12,000 US taxing jurisdictions and over 200 countries, ensuring your transaction tax is calculated based on the most current tax rules.

The new officially certified Spree AvaTax extension helps Spree users and developers to switch from the old Avalara REST API V1 to the latest [Avalara REST API v2](https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/). In the words of Avalara developers "the benefits are huge" as the new API V2 offers improved AvaTax performance, reliability and a wide range of new functionality.

And since AvaTax delivers sales and use tax calculations at the time of checkout or billing — in real time — the business benefits from implementing the new Spree AvaTax V2 extension are significant, potentially improving conversion rates and sales results.

## Maintenance & support

The new extension comes with technical support from both Spree Commerce core team and Avalara and will be maintained to keep up with the innovations introduced by Avalara in the future. The old extension will no longer be maintained or supported.

## Migrating from spree_avatax_certified

The old extension spree_avatax_certified using the old Avalara REST API V1 will no longer be maintained or supported by the Spree team.

If you need to migrate from the old spree_avatax_certified to the new spree_avatax_official, in order to take advantage of the improved AvaTax performance, reliability and new functionality, there are various ways of ensuring backwards compatibility of Orders (eg. for refund purposes) which were committed to Avatax using the old extension.

Please reach out through the [Spree contact form](https://spreecommerce.org/contact/) to discuss an optimal strategy for your use case.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_avatax_official/factories'
```
